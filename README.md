# Keycloak

Keycloak is an Open Source Identity and Access Management solution for modern Applications and Services.

## Purpose

This repository contains the source code for the various tests of approaches to implement new features.
The repository is to enable for quicker turnaround of ideas, thus some of the projects inside might be
obsolete while others very lively.

The top level directories correspond to features being explored, and contains a `README.md` with explanation
of the feature, and one or more subdirectories. Each of the subdirectories represents one alternative
approach for implementation of the feature.

Some directories may also contain the "playgrounds" or example applications to show specific Keycloak features.

### FAPI playground

Example demo application for showing FAPI feature and some other OAuth/OIDC related features like DPoP. For the details, see the [README file of the FAPI playground](fapi-playground/README.md).
