 * A class implementing a {@code YamlContext} interface represents a transformer
 * from a primitive value / sequence / mapping representation as declared in YAML
 * format into a Java object of type {@code V}, with ability to produce
 * the {@link #getResult() resulting instance} of parsing.
 *
 * <p>
 * NOTE: In the future, this transformer might also cover the other direction:
 * conversion from Java object into YAML primitive value / sequence / mapping representation.
 *
 * <p>
 * This transformer handles only a single nesting level in YAML file. The root level
 * is at the beginning of YAML document. Every mapping key and every sequence then
 * represents next level of nesting.
 *
 * <h3>Examples</h3>
